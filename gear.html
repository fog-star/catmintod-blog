                            <p>Mk.I</p>
                            <p>Built in 2016, i think. me and my Dad basically used his metalworking skills to make a guitar body. We cut out layers of plywood with a waterjet of all things and just glued them together. It would have been very heavy, if we hadn't basically made it a hollowbody for the electronics. It made the pickguard sag inwards, so i filled some of the space with scrap wood and a woolen sock later. Making a neck seemed too daunting, so i bought a Harley Benton JA-60 and took that beautiful bound neck with block inlays for our build. It's quite different from a normal Jagstang in its design and parts: It's a long scale at 25.5 inches with a Jazzmaster vibrato, locking tuners and DiMarzio Super 2 Pickups. I wanted a coil split on both of them via 2 push-pull pots but i didn't know how to do that so we gave it do a friend of my dad. He apparently also didn't know how to do it, despite being an electrician, so i gave it to a guitar tech who fixed it for free because he found it so interesting. The coil split has been working ever since, however, the tone knobs both control both pickups. Despite this, it's been my favourite guitar for almost a decade now.</p>

                            <p>Mk.II</p>
                            <p>This one I made quite impulsively during an intense phase of listening to Superorganism. I wanted a Stratocaster vibrato, because the Mk.I's hadn't worked and I thought the entire system just sucked. It's kind of an antithesis to Mk.I, made from a spruce plank i found in our barn's attic. It's a 24 inch short-scale with Fender Gen. 4 noiseless pickups. I had found an article on how to make a proper guitar finish, which made me put on about 5 layers of pink paint and maybe 10 layers of clearcoat. I had made a terrible mistake. There were air bubbles trapped within, which made the finish permanently squishy. Your fingernail would leave a dent for a while, if you pushed on it. On top of that, i hated the noiseless pickups, they were very different from the metallic chime that i like about single coils. Essentially, this guitar has been a lesson about what not to do and what i don't like in guitars. I am considering to rework it someday but i fear it might be more work than just building another one.</p>

                            <p>By 2020 I had almost figured out what i like in an instrument, which is basically what we had done with Mk.I in the first place. It is also a long scale, but made from a solid piece</p>
